# Müll-O-Mat
Welcome to the Müll-O-Mat! This project is a TinyML-based web application that helps sorting waste in public spaces. It focuses on classifying waste through image classification and providing information on how to sort the waste correctly, specifically targeting types of waste that are typically encountered in public areas such as universities, which are often challenging to sort correctly.
